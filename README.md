House Price Prediction

This is a very small machine learning project I did while learning the basics.
I used one feature (house size) to predict the house price using linear regression.

I didn’t use sklearn for training. Instead, I wrote gradient descent manually so I can understand:

how the line is fitted

what the cost function does

how w and b update every iteration

The code loads the data, runs gradient descent, and then plots the final line.

How to run
python ml_gradient_descent.py

What it prints

final w, b

training loss

a sample prediction

The main purpose of this project was to understand gradient descent.
